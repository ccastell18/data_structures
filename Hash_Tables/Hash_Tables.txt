Hash Tables
Keys are a way to find items in memory.
A Hash Function decides where key and value are placed.

idempotent - Same output from the same input.

Hash function takes a hash and turns it into an index or memory address.

insert, lookup, delete, and search are all O(1)

Hash Collision is when 2 keys try to save at the same address

Hash Tables vs Arrays

-Arrays are ordered. Hash Tables are not.
