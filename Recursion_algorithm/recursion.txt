-Recursion is more of a concept.
-Recursion refers to itself inside of the function

Stack Overflow
-when the calls within the function are too much
-basically each call of the function adds to the Stack and nothing is taken off of the Stack and it overflows.
-recursion takes up memory.

Base Case
-An added code that stops the recursion after a certain amount of calls.
