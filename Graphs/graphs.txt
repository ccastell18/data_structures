Graph

-each item in a node is a node or vertex
-connected with edges
-use trees and linked lists

Directed Graph
-can only go in certain directions

Undirected Graph
-flow of information between nodes can go both ways.

Unweighted graph
-all info is contained in the nodes, which are directed

Weighted graph
-the info is in the nodes and on the edges (goole maps)

Cyclic
-can move from node to node and return to the original node

Acyclic
- move from node to node and doesn't return to the original node.
