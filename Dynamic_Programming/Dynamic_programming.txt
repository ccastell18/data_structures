Dynamic Programming

-Just a fancy way of using caching
-solves small problems and saves the info

Memoization

-caching- saving info that will be necessary for programs.
-memoization caches the return value of a function based on the parameter.If the parameter does not change, it will return the memoized version(cached) to speed the program.
-remember the solution to a solve problem

-running a fibonacci regularly, the calculations overlap while searching the binary trees.
-memoized version caches all numbers so it is easy to find numbers already traversed.
