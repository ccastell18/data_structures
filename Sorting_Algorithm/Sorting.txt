Sorting

Not all sorting is the same. Different browsers can sort in different manners. Using .sort() will not always put numbers in order. It converts to strings and reads like Char codes.

- When choosing sorting algorithms, they are split into Time Complexity and Space Complexity.


Elementary Sorts
-Bubble Sort
Start at the beginning and compare two numbers at a time.   [8,3,5,9]
it would start with 8 and 3.  The lower of the two numbers would be moved to the left, then move on to the next two numbers which would be 8 and 5. It repeats until its arranged lowest to highest. Simple but inefficient. O(n^2)

Selection Sort
-Scans data to find the smallest element and switches it to the first spot and repeats through the elements.O(n^2)

Insertion Sort
-Sorts the list by iterating the elements. It compares the element to the previous element and puts them in order, inserting them in the right positions.


Complex Sorts(Divide and Conquer)
- implements recursion
- Big O value of O(n log n)
-High Time Complexity, slow Space Complexity

Merge Sort
-takes an array and divides and divides until each element is a single element.
-Then compares two elements next to each other like a tree sort.  
- compares two at a time until they are all ordered. Then repeat with neighbor elements.
-stable which will keep the original order.

Quick Sort ( usually best sorting option)
-uses a pivoting technique
-breaks main list into smaller lists
-smaller lists use pivot until sorted
-pivot is picking a number and sort all numbers before and numbers after on both sides. 
-then pivots again on the two new lists. And repeated until everything is sorted.


When to use sorting algorithm?
Insertion - input small or mostly sorted data
Bubble - never
Selection - never
Merge sort - divide and conquer. no worst case scenario. uses lots of space complexity though
Quick sort- better than merge sort, but terrible if it picks the wrong pivot number. Less space complexity.

Non Comparison Sorts
- Counting Sort or Radix Sort
-only works with numbers in a certain range.
