Sorting

Not all sorting is the same. Different browsers can sort in different manners. Using .sort() will not always put numbers in order. It converts to strings and reads like Char codes.

- When choosing sorting algorithms, they are split into Time Complexity and Space Complexity.


Elementary Sorts
-Bubble Sort
Start at the beginning and compare two numbers at a time.   [8,3,5,9]
it would start with 8 and 3.  The lower of the two numbers would be moved to the left, then move on to the next two numbers which would be 8 and 5. It repeats until its arranged lowest to highest. Simple but inefficient. O(n^2)
