Stacks & Queues

-stacks and queues are linear, sequentially

Stacks
-LIFO = Last In First Out

Big O
lookup O(n)
pop    O(1)
push   O(1)
peek   O(1)

Queues
-FIFO = First In First Out

Big O
lookup  O(n)
enqueue O(1)
dequeue O(1)
peek    O(1)

- Can be built with arrays and Linked Lists

-Arrays
-cache locality, next to each other
-static or dynamic memory which will double up on memory
-Never build a queue with an array, would have to shift indexes with each one.

-Linked List
-scattered all over
-extra memory because of pointers
-more dynamic memory
-good for queues because we reference the head and tail.
